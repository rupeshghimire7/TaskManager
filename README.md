## ML Model (SVM)

The SVM model in this project is trained using the Jupyter Notebook environment. It's designed to analyze task details and assign priorities based on various factors such as deadline, category, estimated time to complete task, complexity, and importance to calsulate a priority value and assign it to the task.
